    <h1>What is Seamless for OpenSCAD?</h1>
    <p>The Seamless compiler can import <a href="http://www.OpenSCAD.org/">OpenSCAD</a> <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Modules">modules</a> directly 
    from a online module library. It works as a precompiler.</p>
    <p>Example: If you want to design a wall mount for your arduino, you may need to measure the 
    positions of the mounting holes of your arduino. It's far easier if you search for a module that can
    create those holes for you, and just call ~px-arduino_mega_with_sainsmart_lcd-v1(only_make_bores = true);
    </p>

    <h1>How can i use it?</h1>
    <p><a href="">Download the seamless compiler for Windows</a> or <a href="">Linux</a> and install it. Start it.</p>
    <p>The compiler (also known as client) simply watches a whole directory including subfolders for changes. 
    Whenever you edit or create a .scad file, the compiler instantly compiles it into a .compiled.scad file.</p>
    <p>Choose a directory and click "Start"</p>
    <p>Depending on your habbits, you may have to adapt a new habbit: 
    <strong>You can not use the built-in OpenSCAD text editor anymore</strong>.
    </p> 
    <p>You have to use an external editor. I recommend <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> for
    Windows and gedit or kate for Linux. Create and edit your my_new_design.scad file in your favorite editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open OpenSCAD. Load the my_new_design.compiled.scad file into OpenSCAD. You can hide the built-in editor in OpenSCAD
      via Menu->View->Hide editor. You also need to enable Menu->Design->'Automatic reload and compile'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can edit your design. Whenever you save your file (Ctrl + S) it precompiles (searches for online modules)
       and compiles automatically.

    <h1>Known Issues</h1>
    <p>This project is very young. Some things are planned but not yet implemented</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tagging</li>
      <li>Handling of includes</li>
      <li>Calling online modules from online modules</li>
      <li>Searching for more than one word</li>
      <li>Design (It's horrible currently)</li>
      <li>Creating new versions</li>
      <li>Ajax for smarter navigation and search</li>
      <li>Remove need for javascript: currently it's used for less.js, a clientside css compiler</li>
      <li>Functions, not only modules, but thats a only a regex thing</li>
      <li>English grammar and vocabulary :D Sorry</li>
      <li>Download counter</li>
      <li>Version check</li>
    </ul>
